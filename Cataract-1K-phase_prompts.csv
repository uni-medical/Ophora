Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as incision,incision_1,"A diamond or steel keratome blade is used to create a small, self-sealing incision in the cornea, providing access to the anterior chamber of the eye. This incision allows the introduction of surgical instruments while maintaining intraocular pressure."
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as viscoelastic,viscoelastic_1,"A viscoelastic agent, such as sodium hyaluronate, is injected into the anterior chamber using a cannula. This agent maintains space, protects the corneal endothelium, and stabilizes the anterior chamber during the surgery."
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as capsulorhexis,capsulorhexis_1,"Using capsulorhexis forceps or a cystotome, the surgeon creates a circular tear in the anterior lens capsule. This opening allows access to the underlying cataractous lens, preparing it for removal."
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as hydrodissection,hydrodissection_1,"Balanced salt solution (BSS) is injected with a cannula between the lens capsule and the lens cortex, separating the cataract from the capsule. This ensures that the lens material can be removed more easily during phacoemulsification."
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as phacoemulsification,phacoemulsification_1,"A phacoemulsification handpiece with an ultrasonic probe is inserted into the eye to emulsify the cataract into tiny fragments. These fragments are simultaneously aspirated, removing the clouded lens while protecting surrounding structures."
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as irrigation-aspiration,irrigation-aspiration_1,A dual-function irrigation and aspiration (I/A) handpiece is used to remove any remaining lens material and fluid from the capsular bag and anterior chamber. The procedure ensures the capsular bag is clear for lens implantation.
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as Capsule-Pulishing,Capsule-Pulishing_1,"A polishing tip or I/A tool is used to gently remove residual epithelial cells from the inner surface of the posterior capsule, minimizing the risk of posterior capsule opacification (secondary cataract formation)."
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as Lens-Implantation,Lens-Implantation_1,An intraocular lens (IOL) is loaded into an injector and inserted through the corneal incision. It is placed within the capsular bag to replace the natural lens and restore the patient's vision.
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as Lens-positioning,Lens-positioning_1,"Using fine-tipped instruments, the surgeon carefully adjusts the position of the IOL within the capsular bag to ensure proper centration and stability, optimizing visual outcomes."
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as viscoelastic-suction,viscoelastic-suction_1,The viscoelastic agent is aspirated from the anterior chamber using the I/A handpiece to prevent postoperative pressure spikes and ensure a clear visual axis.
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as Anterio-Chamber-Flushing,Anterio-Chamber-Flushing_1,The anterior chamber is flushed with balanced salt solution (BSS) to remove any remaining debris or blood. This final rinse ensures that the chamber is clear and that the incision site is clean.
Generate a surgical video clip with the current surgical phase as Tonifying-Antibiotics,Tonifying-Antibiotics_1,"A pupil-constricting agent, such as acetylcholine, may be injected to stabilize intraocular pressure. Following this, an antibiotic such as moxifloxacin is administered to prevent infection, and sometimes corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation."
